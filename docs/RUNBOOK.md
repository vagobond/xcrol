# Xcrol Revival Runbook

If you are reading this because the original operator is unavailable, this
document tells you exactly how to bring Xcrol back online from the backup
bundle + GitHub mirror.

You will need: a credit card, a domain registrar login (the `xcrol.com`
registration), and ~3 hours.

## 0. What you have
1. **Backblaze B2 bucket** `xcrol-backups` — daily snapshots (last 90 days).
2. **GitHub repository mirror** — full app source, migrations, edge functions.
3. **The trustee letter** (if delivered via deadman switch) — contains B2
   access credentials and any context the operator left.

If you are missing the B2 credentials, contact the operator's heirs / lawyer;
without them, you can still revive the *application* from GitHub but you will
lose all user data.

## 1. Choose a hosting path

| Path | Monthly cost | Effort | When to choose |
| ---- | ------------ | ------ | -------------- |
| **A. Managed Supabase + Cloudflare Pages** | ~$25–45 | low | You want minimum ops work |
| **B. Self-hosted Supabase on Hetzner** | ~$8–15 | medium | You want full sovereignty |

Both paths share steps 2–6.

## 2. Provision the backend

### Path A — managed Supabase
1. Sign up at supabase.com, create a new project in your region of choice.
2. Note the project ref, anon key, service role key, and DB URL.
3. Enable the `pg_cron` and `pg_net` extensions (Database → Extensions).

### Path B — self-hosted Supabase
1. Spin up a Hetzner CPX21 (or larger) running Ubuntu.
2. Follow https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker — set strong
   `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET`, `ANON_KEY`, `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
3. Put it behind Caddy with a TLS cert.

## 3. Restore the schema
From the GitHub mirror:

```bash
git clone <mirror-url> xcrol && cd xcrol
# Apply migrations in order. Each migration is idempotent w.r.t. its own
# CREATE statements; run them with the Supabase CLI:
npx supabase link --project-ref <new-ref>
npx supabase db push
```

This recreates every table, RLS policy, function, trigger, and grant.

## 4. Restore the data

Pick the most recent successful backup folder in B2 (look for a folder that
contains a `manifest.json.gz` with `errors: []`).

```bash
# Install the B2 CLI and authenticate
pip install b2
b2 account authorize <key-id> <application-key>

# Pull the snapshot you want
b2 sync b2://xcrol-backups/xcrol/2026-06-04/<timestamp> ./snapshot
gunzip ./snapshot/db/*.gz ./snapshot/auth/*.gz ./snapshot/storage/*.gz

# Load each table. Order matters because of FKs — load parents first.
# A pragmatic order:
for t in profiles user_roles user_settings user_invites \
         friendships friendship_requests custom_friendship_types blocked_users \
         introduction_requests references messages \
         brooks brook_posts brook_comments brook_reactions \
         groups group_members group_join_requests group_posts group_post_comments group_post_reactions group_visits \
         xcrol_entries xcrol_reactions river_replies river_reply_reactions \
         scrolls scroll_items scroll_publications scroll_publication_reactions \
         social_links personal_info profile_widgets \
         hosting_preferences meetup_preferences hosting_requests meetup_requests \
         town_listings developer_apps oauth_authorizations rss_feeds \
         waitlist deletion_requests audit_log user_points; do
  echo "Loading $t..."
  # Re-build INSERTs from NDJSON, or use this one-liner with jq + psql:
  jq -rc --arg t "$t" '[. ] | "INSERT INTO public.\($t) SELECT * FROM jsonb_populate_recordset(NULL::public.\($t), $1::jsonb);"' \
    ./snapshot/db/$t.ndjson | \
    while read sql; do psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "$sql"; done
done
```

(Simpler: write a 20-line Node script that reads each NDJSON file and calls
`supabase.from(table).insert(rows)` in 500-row batches with the service key.)

### 4a. Restore auth users (preserving passwords)
The dump includes `encrypted_password`. Use the Supabase admin API:

```ts
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";
const admin = createClient(URL, SERVICE_ROLE_KEY);
for (const u of usersFromDump) {
  await admin.auth.admin.createUser({
    id: u.id, email: u.email,
    email_confirm: !!u.email_confirmed_at,
    password_hash: u.encrypted_password, // bcrypt hash from old project
    user_metadata: u.user_metadata,
    app_metadata: u.app_metadata,
  });
}
```

Users keep their original passwords.

### 4b. Storage
The backup contains an object catalog, not bytes. If the original Supabase
project is still reachable, re-download objects directly from there. Otherwise
storage objects are lost; users will need to re-upload avatars and Xcrol will
auto-regenerate OG images.

## 5. Re-create secrets
The manifest lists every secret name that was set at backup time. You must
re-provision values yourself:

| Secret | Where to get a new value |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| `LOVABLE_API_KEY` | If Lovable AI is unavailable, leave this unset. BYOK in Scrolls keeps working. |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | resend.com → API keys |
| `MAPBOX_TOKEN` | mapbox.com → tokens (or switch to MapTiler) |
| `B2_*` | reuse the bucket above |
| `CRON_SECRET` | generate a fresh random string |

## 6. Deploy the frontend
Cloudflare Pages: connect to the GitHub mirror, set build command `bun run build`,
output `dist`. Set env vars `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`,
`VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` from the new Supabase project.

Vercel: same idea — framework "Vite", same env vars.

## 7. Point DNS
Update `xcrol.com` A/CNAME records to the new host. TTL low (300s) for the
first 24 hours so you can revert quickly.

## 8. Smoke test
- [ ] Sign in with an existing account → password works
- [ ] Open the River → entries visible
- [ ] Post a new entry
- [ ] Send a message
- [ ] View someone else's public profile
- [ ] Admin dashboard → Backups tab → trigger a run against the new B2 bucket

## 9. Re-schedule backups
On the new project, re-run the cron SQL in `BACKUP-ARCHITECTURE.md` with the
new project ref + `CRON_SECRET`. You now have a fully self-contained Xcrol.
